# 🛡️ Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository contains three different approaches to detecting fraud in credit card transactions using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## 📁 Folders Overview

### 🔹 real_time_monitor/
A console-based real-time fraud detection dashboard using XGBoost and Isolation Forest.

### 🔹 model_evaluation/
Focuses on building optimized ML models, handling imbalanced data (SMOTE), and evaluating models using ROC, Precision-Recall, and confusion matrix.

### 🔹 deep_model_analysis/
Compares XGBoost and Autoencoder models, saves the best performing model using joblib, and includes inference time tracking.
